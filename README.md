# Mechanic-Service-Management-API
My first (training) Spring Boot application.

This is an API which helps to manage a mechanic service. User can save/delete/update customers their cars and services.
Moreover, it is possible to search for customers/cars/services basing on their attributes like names, brands, service deadlines etc.
